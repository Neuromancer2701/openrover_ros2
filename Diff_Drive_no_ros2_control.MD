Yes, you can use the `diff_drive_controller` from `ros2_control` without relying on the `ros2_control` system, but it requires a bit of adaptation. `diff_drive_controller` is designed to work as a part of the `ros2_control` framework, which provides hardware abstraction, control loop management, and interfaces for controllers. However, with some changes, you can create a custom ROS 2 node that mimics some of its functionality.

Here’s how you can approach it:

### 1. **Extract the Core Logic from `diff_drive_controller`:**

   First, you’ll need to look into the `diff_drive_controller` source code to extract the parts you need. The main logic to focus on is:
   - Handling the odometry and wheel velocity calculations.
   - Converting cmd_vel (twist message) into individual wheel velocities.
   - Optionally, calculating the wheel positions (odometry).

   The controller essentially reads velocities from a `geometry_msgs/Twist` message (usually published as `/cmd_vel`) and calculates the required velocity for each wheel based on the robot's geometry (wheel radius and track width). It also reads the wheel encoder data (or some other method of determining wheel positions) and uses it for odometry calculations.

### 2. **Create a Custom ROS 2 Node:**

   You can implement a simplified diff-drive controller as a regular ROS 2 node. Here’s a basic structure:

   1. **Subscribe to `/cmd_vel`:**
      Subscribe to the `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` topic to get the desired linear and angular velocities.

   2. **Convert Velocities:**
      Use the diff-drive kinematic equations to convert the linear and angular velocities into wheel velocities.

      The equations are:

      \[
      v_{left} = v - \frac{\omega \cdot L}{2}
      \]
      \[
      v_{right} = v + \frac{\omega \cdot L}{2}
      \]

      Where:
      - \( v_{left} \) and \( v_{right} \) are the left and right wheel velocities.
      - \( v \) is the linear velocity from the `Twist` message.
      - \( \omega \) is the angular velocity from the `Twist` message.
      - \( L \) is the distance between the wheels (track width).

   3. **Publish Wheel Commands:**
      You’ll need to publish the calculated wheel velocities to a topic or interface that your robot can understand (e.g., motor drivers).

   4. **(Optional) Odometry Calculation:**
      If you want to compute the odometry, you’ll need to track the wheel positions (via encoder feedback) and calculate the robot’s pose over time using dead-reckoning techniques.

### 3. **Example Implementation (Pseudocode):**

Here’s a very basic version of what such a node might look like:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from std_msgs.msg import Float64

class DiffDriveController(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('diff_drive_controller')
        self.cmd_vel_sub = self.create_subscription(Twist, 'cmd_vel', self.cmd_vel_callback, 10)
        self.left_wheel_pub = self.create_publisher(Float64, 'left_wheel_velocity', 10)
        self.right_wheel_pub = self.create_publisher(Float64, 'right_wheel_velocity', 10)

        # Parameters for the robot
        self.wheel_separation = 0.5  # Distance between wheels
        self.wheel_radius = 0.1  # Radius of the wheels

    def cmd_vel_callback(self, msg):
        # Extract linear and angular velocities
        linear_velocity = msg.linear.x
        angular_velocity = msg.angular.z

        # Calculate wheel velocities
        left_wheel_velocity = (linear_velocity - angular_velocity * self.wheel_separation / 2) / self.wheel_radius
        right_wheel_velocity = (linear_velocity + angular_velocity * self.wheel_separation / 2) / self.wheel_radius

        # Publish the wheel velocities
        left_wheel_msg = Float64()
        left_wheel_msg.data = left_wheel_velocity
        self.left_wheel_pub.publish(left_wheel_msg)

        right_wheel_msg = Float64()
        right_wheel_msg.data = right_wheel_velocity
        self.right_wheel_pub.publish(right_wheel_msg)

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = DiffDriveController()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### 4. **Handle Wheel Feedback:**

If you want to handle odometry or provide feedback, you’ll need to subscribe to topics or use services that provide information about the actual wheel rotations (e.g., encoders). This feedback will allow you to calculate the robot's pose and improve control accuracy.

### 5. **Why Not Use `ros2_control`?**

If you’re not using `ros2_control` because of specific constraints (e.g., hardware or complexity), you’ll miss out on its useful features like hardware abstraction, controller interfaces, and easier tuning. However, using a pure ROS 2 node like the example above provides flexibility if your use case is more straightforward or you need more control over the logic.

### 6. **Dependencies:**

Even though you're not using `ros2_control`, you may still want to leverage parts of its code. For instance, you could extract and adapt the odometry logic if needed. You could either:
- Copy relevant parts of `diff_drive_controller` code and adapt them to your node, or
- Use the `ros2_control` packages as libraries without using the `controller_manager`.

This approach gives you flexibility in managing the control logic outside of the `ros2_control` ecosystem while still retaining the core functionality.




Here’s an implementation of a simplified differential drive controller in C++ without using the `ros2_control` system. It reads the `/cmd_vel` topic, calculates the required wheel velocities, and publishes them to separate topics for the left and right wheels.

### DiffDriveController (C++) Implementation

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <geometry_msgs/msg/twist.hpp>
#include <std_msgs/msg/float64.hpp>

class DiffDriveController : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
    DiffDriveController() : Node("diff_drive_controller")
    {
        // Subscribe to the cmd_vel topic
        cmd_vel_sub_ = this->create_subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::Twist>(
            "cmd_vel", 10, std::bind(&DiffDriveController::cmdVelCallback, this, std::placeholders::_1));

        // Publishers for left and right wheel velocities
        left_wheel_pub_ = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64>("left_wheel_velocity", 10);
        right_wheel_pub_ = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64>("right_wheel_velocity", 10);

        // Robot parameters
        wheel_separation_ = this->declare_parameter<double>("wheel_separation", 0.5); // Distance between wheels
        wheel_radius_ = this->declare_parameter<double>("wheel_radius", 0.1);         // Radius of wheels
    }

private:
    // Callback for cmd_vel message
    void cmdVelCallback(const geometry_msgs::msg::Twist::SharedPtr msg)
    {
        // Extract linear and angular velocities
        double linear_velocity = msg->linear.x;
        double angular_velocity = msg->angular.z;

        // Compute wheel velocities using differential drive kinematics
        double left_wheel_velocity = (linear_velocity - angular_velocity * wheel_separation_ / 2.0) / wheel_radius_;
        double right_wheel_velocity = (linear_velocity + angular_velocity * wheel_separation_ / 2.0) / wheel_radius_;

        // Publish wheel velocities
        publishWheelVelocity(left_wheel_velocity, right_wheel_velocity);
    }

    // Helper function to publish wheel velocities
    void publishWheelVelocity(double left_velocity, double right_velocity)
    {
        auto left_wheel_msg = std_msgs::msg::Float64();
        left_wheel_msg.data = left_velocity;
        left_wheel_pub_->publish(left_wheel_msg);

        auto right_wheel_msg = std_msgs::msg::Float64();
        right_wheel_msg.data = right_velocity;
        right_wheel_pub_->publish(right_wheel_msg);
    }

    // ROS 2 interfaces
    rclcpp::Subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::Twist>::SharedPtr cmd_vel_sub_;
    rclcpp::Publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64>::SharedPtr left_wheel_pub_;
    rclcpp::Publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64>::SharedPtr right_wheel_pub_;

    // Robot-specific parameters
    double wheel_separation_; // Distance between the wheels
    double wheel_radius_;     // Radius of the wheels
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    // Initialize the ROS 2 node
    rclcpp::init(argc, argv);

    // Create and run the DiffDriveController node
    auto node = std::make_shared<DiffDriveController>();
    rclcpp::spin(node);

    // Clean up and shutdown
    rclcpp::shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Node Setup:**
   - The `DiffDriveController` class inherits from `rclcpp::Node`, creating a standard ROS 2 node.
   - It subscribes to the `/cmd_vel` topic, which provides the robot's desired linear and angular velocities.
   - It has two publishers, one for each wheel's velocity: `/left_wheel_velocity` and `/right_wheel_velocity`.

2. **Parameters:**
   - `wheel_separation`: The distance between the left and right wheels (track width).
   - `wheel_radius`: The radius of the wheels.
   - These parameters are declared and can be set via a YAML file or command line.

3. **Velocity Calculation:**
   - In the `cmdVelCallback()`, the linear and angular velocities from the `cmd_vel` message are used to calculate the left and right wheel velocities using the following equations:

     \[
     v_{left} = \frac{v - \frac{\omega \cdot L}{2}}{r}
     \]
     \[
     v_{right} = \frac{v + \frac{\omega \cdot L}{2}}{r}
     \]

   Where:
   - \( v \) is the linear velocity from the `cmd_vel` message.
   - \( \omega \) is the angular velocity from the `cmd_vel` message.
   - \( L \) is the distance between the wheels (track width).
   - \( r \) is the wheel radius.

4. **Publishing Wheel Velocities:**
   - After calculating the velocities, the values are published to the `/left_wheel_velocity` and `/right_wheel_velocity` topics using the `std_msgs::msg::Float64` message type.

### Running the Node:

You can run the node like any other ROS 2 node. First, compile the package and source the setup file:

1. **Create a package**:
   If you don't already have a package, create one:

   ```bash
   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake diff_drive_controller_cpp
   ```

2. **Add dependencies in `CMakeLists.txt`**:
   Make sure to include the necessary dependencies in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

   ```cmake
   find_package(geometry_msgs REQUIRED)
   find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)
   ```

3. **Build the package**:
   Build your workspace:

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

4. **Run the node**:
   After building, you can run the node using:

   ```bash
   ros2 run diff_drive_controller_cpp diff_drive_controller
   ```

### Optional: Setting Parameters

You can define the `wheel_separation` and `wheel_radius` parameters in a YAML file or via the command line. For example, to launch with parameters via the command line:

```bash
ros2 run diff_drive_controller_cpp diff_drive_controller --ros-args -p wheel_separation:=0.6 -p wheel_radius:=0.15
```

This simple C++ node implements the basic functionality of the `diff_drive_controller` but without using the `ros2_control` framework. It provides a more flexible, ROS 2 node-based approach, which can be customized as needed.
